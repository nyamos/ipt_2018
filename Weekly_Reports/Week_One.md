## Introductory
On 30th july,2018 first day of the Industrial Practical Training (IPT) at CIVE, The University of Dodoma. The team was very passionate with full energy ready to dig into Machine learning,
we use few minutes to introduce each other and get to know one another, there after we set goals for the week according to the schedule which involes
reading several chapters from selected book, pass through notebooks about intro to python on ML, and selected online courses, Also understanding proposed project to be done using Machine Learning.

Through the first few days i was able to grasp general meaning and understainding of what is machine learning, that is solving different problem by learning from data. The way its learn from data is what give its types, such that;  
* it can learn from meaningful data, which output is alrdeay know (i.e. called Supervised Learning)
* it can learn from data which no output known (i.e called Unsupervised Learning)
* reward/ penalt by action performed from learned data (i.e. Reinforcement learning) [see more](https://github.com/nyamos/ipt_2018/edit/master/hands%20On%20ML%20with%20Scikit-learn%20&%20TF/chapter%20One(summary).md).  

Supervised learning, this type of machine learning is useful for solving classification problems and regression problems, of which in classification problem is by predicting a descrete value, given input while in regression problem is by predicting continuous value given an input of data. When trying to solve these kind of problems, having data and proper model is very important thing, i was able to learn some regression model (linear regression model) from [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) first week.  
Just a brief insight on linear regression model,is used to solve a regression problem. It use hypothesis fuction h(X) to learn from data, so that h(x) is a good predictor for corresponding value of y. To measure accuracy of the model, cost function(squared error function) is used, which take average square diference of actual and predicted value. Using a Gradient Descent is where you can estimate parameters of the hypothesis and reach Global minimal(global optimal), which is actually your prediction.

Also, i learned about the machine learning project, that my team will be working on. General Purpose Recommendation Engine, is aiming to recommend people on different aspects, of which we start with enterntainment(i.e music,movies,trending news), online business(i.e electronics, clothes).

lastly, a weekly challenge, which real help me know how practically things are done in solving machine learning problem from loading my data, visualising it, train algorithm to prediction on new data (notebooks help in these parts). The intresting thing about this challenge is how its able to teach me about things and theories that i think i already know, only to find out i dont real know them. Otherwise, i think its give the way forward on the reality of machine learning problems and encourage team work.
