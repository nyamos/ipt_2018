# Introduction
Machine learning seem to take highlight into the technology industry which make it look like a new technology, but the truth is, it has been around for awhile now since the application of [Optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition).
Machine learning start to be noticed early in 1990s on the discovery of spam filter then later on came different applications of it from better recommendation to voice search.
## What is Machine learning?
Machine learning is the use data to decide by learning from them, to clarify this, for example; teacher want to know how many student in the class will pass final exam using previous recorded performance. To add more  meaning here is a general definition from Arthur Samuel [machine learning] "field of study which gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." ,1959
## How it is implimented?
consider number of student pass final exam example; for a teacher to have previous student records does not real do anything, it could be any record, but see the teacher choose previous performance records of the student, knowing it could at least provide an insight for this case. However, previous performance alone does not real guarantee the pass or fail of a student but it will do the trick. then to analyse this data so as to be able to make a decision we need a model/ algorithm for such activity. Great, now that there is model, still it is not enough to have an accuracy, so, we provide our model with different scenarios of student performance records that lead to failure or pass and it learn from them, which later on when a new record presented to the model it will be able to predict if its a fail or pass.

 ## Why Machine learning
There is a lot of reasons, but it's ability of evolving accordingly contrast to traditional programming is profound. In traditional programming every changes and rules that guide application must be coded to cope with different situations, but Machine Learning require a proper algorithm and datset to cope with different situations.
